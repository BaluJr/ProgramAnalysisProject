We provide two scripts 'suggest.sh' and 'extract_histories.sh' that will be used to test your solution. You should update both scripts by following the instructions provided inside them and include them in your submission.



## Repository Overview:
Folder HistoryExtraction: 	Contains all code and the testcases given for history extraction.
Folder Prediction:		All code concerning the deep learning and code prediction.



## READMEs
There is an README File within each folder describing the contained elements of the folder.



## Execution:
The main .sh files are still in this main folder and can be called as demanded in the assignment.
