This is the folder for the histories testfiles:

A) It contains the test given by ETH:
programs.json 
test

B) It contains TestingCode, which is a possibility to write own code which is then parsed.
This is for debugging purposes when the Flag UseTestingCodejs in extract_histories.js is set to true.
The json AST created from the TestingCode.js is saved within TestingCode_programs.js

C) ResultingHistories:
A potential output file!?
