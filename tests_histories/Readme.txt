The Main.info is the output of the json_printer.

It was called by me with the following parameters out of its directory:
 ./bin/syntree/main --num_data_records=1 --data=/home/pa/Desktop/Repository/ProgramAnalysisProject/tests_histories/programs.json -log_dir=/home/pa/Desktop/Repository/ProgramAnalysisProject/tests_histories
